# How I quit my job and failed at being an Indiehacker/Bootstrapper

(The tale, adapted for Indiehackers, Twitter, Reddit, ProductHunt)

## Indiehackers

### Background

Three years ago I was lucky to get a job at a big tech company straight out of college. I had done an internship at this company while I was an undergrad. They offered me a full-time position before I even finished my senior year. The internship was pretty good, so I accepted the job. I was coasting.

When I got to the job, it wasn't the quite the same. I was on a totally different team. The team was pretty new, so there wasn't a great social dynamic between members. The product we were working on was brand new. So there were all of the "startup in a big co" issues. I wasn't satisfied. We could have been doing so much more.

I eventually quit that job to work at a consulting firm. The compensation was even better than the first. The team was really great, too. The only thing was that this work was not fulfilling. We were building an ecommerce site in Angular.

### The Indiehacker Itch

I had been hacking away on a side project on nights and weekends for awhile at this point. I thought that if I quit to work full-time on it, I would be successful and never need to work for someone else again.

So I saved up money. I set my sights on building up enough runway to be able to quit for a year and work on whatever I want.

On November 8, 2019 I quit my fulltime job. (I gave appropriate notice and everything and left on great terms with my employer). I thought I had quit to start a business. In reality, I had quit to become unemployed.

### Finally! Working fulltime on a project

Now, this side project. I had been working on it on the side on and off for roughly a year at this point. It was just a cool idea I thought I could build with React and SVG. I hadn't done any customer development. Hell, I had barely talked to anyone about the product except a few close friends (who, let's be honest, will never really be honest to you when you say, check out my idea!)

When I quit, I thought that was going to be the game changer. Now I'd be able to focus and get a customer. I just needed to build a few more features first.

That was it. That sentence is what has driven my failure. Thinking that just adding some more features before showing it to people would make them melt at how amazing it was when I showed it to them.

I would go through this process many times to come.

### Stuck in a doom loop

Set goal on a few features to build -> Focus and work really hard for a week or two to build them -> Finish those features, but end up feeling like there was still something missing -> Decide what new features were missing that would make it great

I was stuck in a doom loop. I was in this never-ending cycle of building features and never being satisfied enough with the result to be excited to show it to people. I was never even getting any real feedback other than that from my own ego.

It's been 7 months since I quit. I have shipped Polished, but it's really nothing great. It doesn't even hold parity with a basic text editor.

### Making peace with where I'm at

I had a feeling that things weren't working this whole time. I knew I should have been talking to people. I should have been validating an idea. But I kept letting my ego tell me what I was doing was the best thing since sliced bread.

After a conversation about it with a friend this weekend, I started thinking about the value of spending my time on Polished. I have gotten a bit of interest from people about the concept, but the execution is just not there at this time. 

### What's next

I'm going to take a break from it. I still have a few months of runway left, so I'm going to start something new. I'm going to start something much much smaller. I'm going to follow the principles laid down by bootstrappers before me. I'm going to build a landing page to collect email addresses first. I'm going to talk to as many people as I can about the idea I come up with. I'm going to work in public and write about everything I do along the way.

I don't want to sound spammy, but as I don't have a landing page yet, if you'd like to see what I do next, follow me here on Indiehackers or on Twitter! Feel free to DM me about what you're working on and I'll be sure to check it out and follow you back.
