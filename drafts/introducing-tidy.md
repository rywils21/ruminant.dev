# The Tidy Saga

The overarching story outline for what I'll be working on. For internal use only. This is the overarching structure in which the series of blog posts will fall into. To help guide my thinking on what I'll be writing about.

1.  (You) Starting - Breaking from Polished

Why I'm deciding to stop working on Polished for now and start a new project.

2.  (Need) Need a win

I need to do a project that is going to be successful. Need to actually follow advice, build something simple, and go through the process of getting customers.

3.  (Go) Starting the project

How I'm going to go about it, following actual advice. Building a landing page first, blogging about it, talking to potential users.

4.  (Search) Building and Marketing

This is where most blog posts will lie. Talking about the challenges of building the chrome extension and the challenges of marketing, and how I'm going about it. (Reddit, Indiehackers, Twitter, PH)

5.  (Find) Launch on PH and HN

This is the big launch. The thing I'm finding is doing an actual launch of a product instead of just dreaming about it.

6.  (Take) Pass or Fail

This will be the result of building up to a launch. It will either go really well or really bad. (Indifference here is bad)

7.  (Return) Deciding what to do next

I will either open a world of features to build for this chrome extension or it will be a short lived product lifecycle that will now just sit in the chrome store.

8.  (Change) In the world with a launch under my belt

I now have the experience of going through this whole process. I can reflect on how it went, what I need to do differently next time, and choose what to work on next.
