# What I learned doing 56 landing page reviews

1. You
I recently decided to start working on a new idea for a project. I decided i was going to validate the idea before writing any code for the product. So I started by building a landing page.



2. Need
I wanted to get some feedback



3. Go
I posted a request for landing page feedback on IH. It just so happened that orliesarus made a video of it and his feedback was incredibly helpful



4. Search
I decided to do the same thing for others because it was so helpful




5. Find
In total, across the Indiehackers post, ProductHunt, and few people on Twitter, I made 56 videos of me doing landing page feedback.




6. Take
That was a ton of work, but here's what I learned.



7. Return 




8. Changed

ii. Two big things:

a. Customer problem
We are often so excited by our products that when it comes to the landing page, we think the most important thing is to start talking about it's amazing features. A random visitor arriving at our landing page has no idea what to expect. Whereas we work on it probably close to everyday and have all these pre-conceived notions.

You need to state a problem that hits the emotional pain a customer feels around something. (Exmaples maybe) This will help the customer read the rest of the content on your page with a feeling of "Yes! they are gonna solve this thing for me, let me find out how"

b. Too much fluff
I think we all read some of the marketing ideas like "tell your customers how they're gonna feel", describe how my app is beautiful/easy-to-use/fast/powerful etc. These adjectives are all fluff and don't help to communicate how the product will actually solve the problem for the customer. Don't describe your features with adjectives, tell the customer how it will solve their problem, and let them arrive at feeling those adjectives on their own. Saying it's powerful doesn't make it true.

iii. A few smaller things
a. Pricing - Put the pricing on your landing page. It's okay to ahve a separate page dedicated to pricing and all the details around it. But put it on your landing page so they can understand that piece of it without needing to click to another page

b. Too many paragraphs - People scan landing pages. They don't read big long paragraphs. I'm guilty of this, too. We want to describe everything about it, but that's a lot of effort all for naught becuase people scan the headings and move on. If the headings aren't grabbing their attention and getting the full picture of what teh product is, they probably won't get it. They aren't gonna stop to read anything just because you want them too.

c. Don't link to other pages and expect them to go there - put the pertinent information on the landing page. Don't put it on another page and ask them to click a link. IT takes a lot of effort to convince visitors to take any action. Asking them to click a link is wasting that good will you built up with them when you could have made it easier for them and just put that info right there where tehy are.

d. Don't hide stuff in accordions - People aren't gonna click into each individual item in an accordion to get to teh information. I did for the videos, but often felt an urge to skip right over them.
