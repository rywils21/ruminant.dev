An outline for how I worked on coming out of my shell online, facing hard feedback

1. You - Me, interested in being an indiehacker
I've been a lurker for YEARS on all kinds of social sites. Reddit, IH, Twitter. My Reddit account is over 4 years old. Less than 6 months ago I only had 5 karma. Less than two months I only had 40 karma. Just this past week I made a post that gave me 70 some karma. Fake internet points, yay.

My twitter account is 5 years old. I gained more than 1/3 of my followers in the past week.


2. Need - to build an audience
I knew I wanted to build saas products. But to do that I needed an audience.


3. Go - Starting to post on social sites
I would try to make posts and comments



4. Search - Searching for how to build an audience
Immediately get discouraged when I wouldn't get replies or any likes. I would pull back into my shell and continue lurking for awhile.

Some time would pass, and I would feel ready to go out and try it again. Or I'd feel that I really needed to build an audience. So I'd buck up and go make conversation with people. I had this product I was building, that I wanted people to be interested in. I was smart enough to not be spammy, but it would tarnish the conversations I had.

I would go in eyes wide open looking for points where I could link my project and get them to check it out.

This is absolutely shitty behavior. So I was stuck in this never-ending loop of trying, getting a little bit of traction, but then regressing back into the shell.


5. Find - accounts with zero traction or engagement
Eventually, I realized I needed to take a break from Polished. I was too deep into it. All I wanted was the big audience, happy customers buying my product like hot cakes. 


6. Take - realize I need to stop what I'm doing
What I was doing clearly wasn't working. I had to stop and take a break from Polished. It was ruining my interactions online. I wasnt' being a genuine human being and treating others like genuine human beings. They were customers who were going to buy my stuff. This is shitty behavior.

(post analytics from tweets and what not)


7. Return - Taking a break, starting with a new attitude
I'm taking a complete break from the project and going to explore some other stuff.


8. Changed
I've immediately found that I'm able to more genuinely interact with people online. Replying to posts is easier. I'm not only replying to things that I think I can drop a link on.

I'm offering help with nothing expected in return by doing landing page videos. Just being a nice person. Deep down, this is what I always wanted to be. I thought that shoving my product down people's throats was helping them because they needed my solution. That was not the case at all.

I no longer feel like I need to be a lurker. If a post doesn't get interaction, that's completely fine. When you don't have an ulterior motive, you aren't let down when something doesn't go how you expected it to.
