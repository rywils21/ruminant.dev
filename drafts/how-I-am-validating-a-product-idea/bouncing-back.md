# Bouncing back from a failure and doing things better

(A new title for the "how I'm validating my product idea")

I've started and stopped five or six times on this post. At first it was effort to blog regularly and make connections online. I was going to publish it as "How I'm validating a product idea". The first time.

Something didn't feel right about that.

I'm sticking to the premise that it's not about publishing on a cadence, once or week or once a month, or anything like that. The publish no matter what is a bad trope.

It's better to only publish high-quality shit. Sure, there are benefits to publishing consistently, like a more a engaged audience, more momentum, etc. But you shouldn't let the golden fruit of better returns drive you to produce garbage.

Focus on publishing high-quality shit. Then focus on publishing high-quality shit more consistently.

(needs editing but this is rock-solid)
