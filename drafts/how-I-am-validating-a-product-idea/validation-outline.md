    - From here, show the improvements I made

1. You
Me, a person reeling from the realization that I had spent 7 months going about doing a startup the wrong way.


2. Need
I need to get back out there. I'm not quite ready to go back to a 9-5 job. 


3. Go
Going to try starting a new project.


4. Search
I had this idea for a project based on tryshift.com. After seeing switchextension.com, I realized that it could be built as a browser extension.
Shift was trying to move your entire workflow into their browser. As a dev, this wasn't cool because their browser wasn't as full featured.

This time wasn't like the last. I was going to lead with finding customers. Real customers, who would actually pay. So I built a landing page and made some design mockups and set out to get feedback.


5. Find
I got some feedback. From some people, who I talked to personally, they got what it was about and were pretty interested. From other people who only saw the landing page, they didn't really understand it. I got some really great feedback from [video man]


6. Take
Now armed with this feedback, I set out to improve it. It was so eye-opening to see how people who didn't have the same idea in my head didn't get it from the landing page. When I looked at it, I was like, wow this is so good, people are gonna love it. People didn't even understand it!

So I made changes, and got feedback again. This time (hopefully) better. Then I posted it in places where actual potential customers might be hanging out.

Then I got more feedback.


7. Return
So now it's time to start building. I need to continue communicating with potentially interested people, making things as clear as possible. Build at the same time. Build little bits and then share. And continue on this arc.


8. Changed
It's not about having a great idea, building it, and releasing it into the world. Not only did that not work, it made things worse. I approached every conversation with an ulterior motive to get that person to use my crappy app. You need to actually connect with people. Be kind to them and give them things they didn't expect.

I have to be open to getting negative feedback. I thought my landing page was amazing. It's this app that solves this problem I have. How could anyone else not get it? They aren't you. They don't have all of the complex ideas of what it's going to do up in their head. There are a lot of gaps we're leaving out on landing pages that we don't even notice because that gap is already filled in our head.

Go out and give honest landing page reviews to other people. At some point, someone will return the favor and your eyes will be illuminated to the fact that your landing page has a lot of holes to plug.
