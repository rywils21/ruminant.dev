# How I'm validating my product idea

Last week I wrote about how I had quit my job and spent seven months working on a product idea before realizing I had built something that nobody wanted. I got great feedback on Reddit so I want to keep posting here to spot check my decisions before I move too far on them.

I had to take a break from that project I was working on. There may be something there, but I was never going to find it with the mindset I was. I've had another idea for something I wanted to work on.

This time I wasn't going to spend a long time trying to build it and then go out and find people who want to use it. I'm going to actually follow some of the advice that's always talked about on entrepreneur forums. "Talk to your customer" "Find a problem to solve"

I had an idea for a product that was similar to an app I already use and pay for. There are a lot of apps and browser extensions in this space, so I spent some time researching them.

I started by creating some design mockups and building a landing page to make it easier to get feedback. It took about one day to get the first round of these done. I've been pretty active on IndieHackers and I made a post asking for a Landing Page review. Someone was generous enough to make a video reviewing my landing page as someone who hadn't ever seen it before. It was so helpful to see all of the knowledge gaps they had. The things that were in my head, so when I looked at it it seemed clear. To them, it was just a bunch of gaps.

I quickly got to work on reworking the landing page to answer all of the questions they had had. Then I started reaching out to people I was DM'ing with. I started offering to do landing page reviews for other people because that had been so helpful for me. A few people that I did videos for were so happy with it they offered to do it for me in the future. So with my updated landing page, I was ready to cash in on that. I've gotten one of those videos back and again it was incredibly helpful in finding knowledge gaps in my landing page.

So now I'm going to continue iterating on the idea. Gathering feedback. And iterating.

Eventually I will need to go build it. I currently have six people on the waitlist who want to use the product. I was going to keep iterating until I got to ten people who sign up.

Am I missing anything vital at this point? What am I doing wrong that might threaten this project?
