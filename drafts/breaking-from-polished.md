# Breaking from Polished

## You - establish a protagonist

I'm a software engineer. I went to college, not really knowing what I wanted to do. Found the world of programming. Internships helped me get a job. I got a great job straight out of college. Was able to pay off all of my debt. Then I was just a software engineer but didn't like the work.

## Need - "Something aint quite right"

I wanted to work on my own projects. Work on cooler things. Not just coding things that other people made the decisions about. I finally had enough money saved and few enough expenses that I felt comfortable quitting my job to pursue working on projects of my own.

## Go - "Crossing the threshold"

I quit my fulltime job. I had a side project I had been working on that started as a just a cool idea. I knew that with React and SVG I could do cool things in the browser. It had started as a design app. But I quickly found I wouldn't be able to compete with the likes of figma. I wanted to build an audience. To do that, I needed to become a good writer. So I started researching some other apps in the writing space. I wanted to build the best features of them into Polished.

I started just diving deep into Polished, trying to build what I thought was a great app.

## Search - "Road of trials"

That didn't go so well. I was half implementing bootstapped startup advice I was reading. Trying to do marketing hacks, implementing one piece at a time. Struggling with the technical implementation of Polished. Not talking to potential users. Not figuring out a real problem to be solved. I was building a writing app for myself and it was taking way longer than I had hoped. The markdown processing was too difficult.

## Find - "Meeting with the goddess"

So here I was, unemployed, just working on projects. Nothing to really push me to do anything great. I succumbed to playing way too many video games. I wasn't motivated. Every now and again I would try to push through and I'd make some progress. But not enough.

## Take - "Meet your maker"

Now I'm at a point where I'm getting very close to need to make money again. Polished is still weeks of development away from being something very useful. Months away from meeting the vision of building communities within it.

## Return - "Bringing it home"

I've decided to take a break from working on Polished. I'm going back to square zero. Starting a different product that I know will be easier to build and there are people who will pay for it.

## Change - "Master of both worlds"

It will be much simpler, less of a grand vision. I'll actually follow advice. I'm starting work on Tidy. It will be a workspace manager for chrome.
