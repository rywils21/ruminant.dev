# Breaking from Polished Draft

This story starts with me going to college as an undecided Major. I knew I wanted to do something along the lines of engineering. But that's very broad. Especially given the university I was attending had 12 different types of engineering majors. Oddly, the "engineering" college, didn't include software engineering. That was in the "computing" college. A silly thing.

Basically, I decided on software engineering after taking the intro to CS classes and deciding that I really like programming. From then on, it was set. I was blessed in that this university with the Software engineering major not in the engineering college required that all students must do a year of paid internships, co-ops as they called them, in order to graduate. Because the school required this, they had partnerships with over 200 companies who would come to a career fair twice a year to screen, interview, and hire for internships and fulltime roles.

Many of the internships would become repeats, where the company would ask the intern back again for their next stint on a co-op. These would also turn into full-time offers in some cases.

I was lucky. I was just a silly student who could solve problems within the confines of a structured course. But I didn't know anything about building apps for the real-world. I didn't know what a server was. But I got a paid internship, that came with company housing and a company car. What a world. This was wild to me coming from a small town growing up on a farm.

I was stoked.

So I graduate, I take the fulltime job offered from the same company where I interned. My senior year of college I didn't even interview at another company once. I already had the offer. I could coast. (I would come to learn later that this bad. Never coast. If you ever have the option between something challenging and doing something where you can just coast, do the challenging thing. Never coast.)

So I take this job. I have a few student loans and a car payment. This job paid so much I was able to pay all of that off within a year and a half of working there. I really don't go out all that much. So everything I saved, I just put toward those things. So there I was, finally debt-free. Living in an overpriced apartment in California. Working at a job that was just handed to me. Making bank.

Something didn't add up, though. I was restless. The work was unfulfilling to say the least. As a dev in a big company, you're just asked to implement the desires of others. It didn't matter if you had other ideas. It was a complex chain of consensus decision making that needed to be traversed in order to change things in the product. I didn't have the knowledge or really the desire to make that happen.

I'll just quit and make my own products, I declared. Over and over. That was all that had to happen. Just quit and everything will be great. So I just kept saving up money. Working a job that I resented. All so one day I could quit and just work on my own stuff.

About 2.5 years out of college, I did it. I had put in about 5 months notice to my boss that come the end of the year I wanted to set out and work on my own things. My boss was the entrepreneurial type as well so they understood the desire.

Now, this is usually the part that people get hung up on. They can't find the courage to quit. They're addicted to the steady income. The world out there is full of unknowns. I had no problem diving right in. I thought I knew everything I needed to know. I was confident that anything I didn't know, I'd certainly be able to figure out.

So off I went. I quit my job with absolutely nothing lined up other than a shaky side project I had been hacking away on at night for the past few years.

I didn't have any prospective customers. There weren't any communities I was super active on online. I would occasionally post and have good interactions with people, but I would always quickly revert to my shy self from the physical world as soon as something didn't seem as well received.

So I started hacking away at this side project. I thought the idea was pretty cool. This was the first red flag. Like, this was a giant red flag waving at me and I was so attracted to the idea that I would be able to build some cool innovative consumer app. Everyone who saw it would love it once it was finished. Second red flag. I just needed to build it so that people would understand the vision. Without seeing it, surely they couldn't imagine what I was trying to do. Third red flag.

And so there I was. Hacking away at this project that I had quit a ridiculously high-paying remote job for.

I quit my job on November 8, 2019.

At first, I attacked the problem with so much ambition. I had been listening to bootstrapper podcasts like "Startups for the rest of us" and "The art of product" for about a year at this point. I felt like I knew everything I needed to know to move forward.

I was shipping features non-stop. Improvements were coming in like crazy. It was just about at the point where all I needed to do was slap on a stripe integration for a paid tier that would help signal if the project was worth working on or not. (This was the startup advice I was lapping up)

Then the holiday break from the end of December, beginning of January came and went. I took a few days off from working on it, and I felt like I lost all momentum. It was hard to get back to it. I had no direction. I had a giant list of features and marketing strategies I wanted to implement, but it felt never-ending. It had already been a month and half of working on this thing full-time and there was no end in sight.

The reasonable thing to do at this point would have been to stop, take stock, and re-evaluate my strategy. Talk to some other people who know what they're doing. Really I should have been majorly alerted by the fact that I had no interested potential customers.

I just kept telling myself that they would come, though. I just needed to complete this feature, or that feature, and then it will be really cool and helpful.

I would end up taking a few days of just devouring video games and not working. After that, I would be recharged to tackle the then final set of features needed to push this over the finish line and then go find some interested customers who would pay lots of money.

I would tackle for a week or two again. Ship a bunch of stuff. Push off things that required a refactor. Or I'd work on the landing page a bit. Trying to follow landing page guides to create the highest converting page it could possibly be. I've probably iterated that landing page and the framework it's built on about 5 times in the last 6 months. Not an efficient use of time.

So I just went through this cycle of sprinting, shipping of bunching of features, only to find that it wasn't complete after all of that effort. Getting burnt out. Self-rationalizing that it only needed a few more features in order to really be a kick-ass app. Take a few days (or more!) to recharge, make no progress, and play way too many video games. Then find some external motivation and repeat this process.

That's what I've been doing for the past seven months since quitting my job. 

I've struggled to ship anything meaningful. I've been running in circles. All to chase this dream of working for myself. (Find!!! Step 5 in the story circle right here).

Now, my savings is starting to hit the critical point where I'm no longer comfortable going on without an income. I have about 1-2 months left. At which point I'll need to start looking for a job.

I'm putting Polished on the backburner. I do still think there is an opportunity there. It just doesn't make sense to continue to spend so much time directly on it. Taking a break will be good to help re-evaluate where it's at and where it's going.

I need to start something new. I need to actually follow the advice of those that have come before me and shared their trials and tribulations. Granted I will always need to adapt the advice to my situation. But I'm kind of at the point where I've got nothing to lose.

I'm not shooting for a home run, here. Just a small win. I'm going to build something that should take less than a week to build and ship. If no one wants to use it by then, I'll know it's a loss. Then I'll need to move on and try something else.

I love the product Shift. I pay for their advanced tier which is $99/year. This is an electron app that saves credentials for multiple gmail accounts, and other apps that require authentication so that you "can be more productive". That's really all it does. Recently, they launched a feature that allows you to open browser tabs within the shift application. They're trying to bring your entire workflow into Shift.

I'm not really a fan of this.

I recently found that it's possible to create this sidebar type of thing as a chrome extension. It would be possible to recreate shift, without the baggage of an electron app and all of the hackery. I only use it for switching between Gmail accounts. So I'm thinking that should be a pretty simple feature set to tackle.

As I start this new journey, I'm pledging to myself that I'm going to go about it the proper way. It's not a guaranteed success. But I'm guaranteed to learn and grow from it in a set amount of time. Instead of letting myself spin my wheels and go nowhere with a product.

I'm going to blog about the entire thing. Plans, actions, and results. This is the first post. I'm really fucking proud of myself for taking the time to write this blog post and share it around before writing any code. Normally, I would sit down for two to three days straight and hack out as much as I possibly could.

If you're interested in how this turns out, come along for the ride.
