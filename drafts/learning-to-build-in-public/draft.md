# Learning to Build in Public

## (You)

I wrote about how I quit my job and failed to start a business a few weeks ago. I had become obsessed with the product I was building. I spent seven months not talking to actual potential customers because I kept telling myself, "If I just build this one feature this product will be amazing."

I decided to take a full on break from that project. Regardless of the value of any kind of idea there, I wasn't executing. I wish I had realized enough to take this break way sooner. But here I am.

I can't give up on building products.

I love building things. I've always been a builder. I grew up on a farm and woud always be tinkering with things. When it would rain heavily, I would play in the ditches along our dirt road and experiment building damns with the rocks and mud. I would nail random scrap boards together to make really useless objects. By high school, I was taking a welding class and I ultimately built a squat rack as my senior project.

So I decided to start fresh. I had spent 7 months building a product but not doing any other entrepreneuring activity properly. I hadn't built an audience or really made any connections.  I hadn't been blogging or tweeting or interacting online in general. I was in my own little bat cave.

## (Need)

I had to start something new.

I always have random ideas pop into my head for products or businesses that I might find useful. Luckily, I've been pretty good about not persuing every single one. In the weeks leading up to my realization that I needed to take a break from Polished, I learned of some chrome extensions that did something similar to an app I paid for called Shift (https://tryshift.com).

## (GO)

Now I was coming to the point in being jobless that I was starting to evaluate all of the subscriptions I had. Shift was $99/year and all I was using it for was switching between email accounts easily.

The thing about Shift was that I loved it's UI. When it comes to working, and organizing things, a sidebar UI works so much better than browser tabs. 

But I still loved my browser. Shift was trying to become the default browser you used. This might work for some people. But as a developer, I frequently need to access the dev tools and am used to a full-featured browser. I didn't want to switch my default browser to Shift.

So I decided to begin working on this idea called Tidy Workspace.

## (Search)

Now I didn't want the same thing that had happened with Polished to happen again with Tidy Workspace. I didn't want to go build this solution and stuck telling myself I needed to build that next feature and people would love it. I had to flip that strategy on it's head.

So I started with talking to people. (Pretty novel idea, right?) It's only what every bit of startup advice will tell you to do.

I spent an hour and built a rough design mockup of the idea I had. It was just going to be a simple replacement for Shift that let you monitor your email accounts from a sidebar in your regular browser.

Then I spent a day building a landing page using the design mockups.

Building the design mockups first did wonders for my ability to build that initial landing page. I was able to include what looked like screenshots of the product right on the initial landing page. I didn't have to resort to using generic illustrations.

I set out to get feedback. 

I posted on Indiehackers and ProductHunt. The initial version was horrible. But I didn't realize that. I was giddy with excitement to get this new idea out there.

By posting on Indiehackers, I happened to get a video review of my landing page from someone. It was the most helpful review I think I've ever gotten on any work. It wasn't helpful because of the suggestions they made. But it was helpful because it helped me realize that there was a ton of information in my head as to how the thing would work but I wasn't being clear at all about that on the actual landing page.

Seeing someone look at my landing page and be confused made it so clear to me that it was because I had ideas in my head already. When I looked at the landing page I would think, "Yeah, makes sense". But when someone with no knowledge of what the product is looks at it, they are straight up confused.

This realization had me so excited. I wanted to share that with other people. So I started offering free landing page reviews for people where I would make a screencast of myself going through their landing page. 

Some people found it incredibly helpful, some people didn't really reply. I made over 70 videos altogether after posting the offer on Indiehackers and ProductHunt. I ended up making a few connections through there of people who had offered to reciprocate.

I made updates to my landing page and product idea based on feedback. Then I reached out to one of the people who had offered to give feedback in return. Used their feedback to make improvements. Then I'd repeat this process. Ask another person, make some updates. So on. Eventually there wasn't much feedback coming in. They understood the idea. Some people were excited about it.

I set up an email drop in the first version of the landing page. In the matter of a week, I had 5 people signed up for early access to an idea. I hadn't even written any code yet.

This was crazy to me!

## (Find)

So with people who seemed to understand the product and indicate they were at least interested in trying it out, I decided to start building.

I wasn't going to build the entire thing. I am sticking to the principle of iterating quickly and getting feedback from people. I decided to just implement a tiny slice of the product. The most important feature: Workspaces.

In one week, I went completely heads down and built this feature.

I learned different concepts that go into building a chrome extension. I created the sidebar that is injected into web pages in a shadow dom node so the Tidy Workspace sidebar doesn't interfere with on page CSS. I set up event listeners to listen to every tab and window change to automatically organize tabs into workspaces.

I learned a lot in this week and submitted a buggy initial version to the chrome web store.

## (Take)

In this week, though, I wasn't active online. I was so consumed with building and learning that I wasn't sharing what I was doing. This might be fine, but it's a dangerous game to play as a developer.

In this week of not posting, traffic from the previous blog post started to die down. Traffic from the weekend of doing landing page reviews started to die down. I was getting fewer messages from new people. It felt like my existence was disappearing.

By the time I was done building this thing, would people even still be interested in it?

When you get the shot of adrenaline that is website traffic and inbound messages, it doesn't feel right when that starts to wear off.

I had told myself I was going to keep blogging this time. I was going to tweet more. There was no reason why I couldn't. I let myself become so consumed with building that I simply didn't make time for those other things because I had convinced myself I needed to build the MVP in a week.

## (Return)

So now I'm coming back to this world of balancing development and engaging with people. I'm writing this blog post. I'm working on tweeting more.

## (Changed)

I'm learning lessons faster. On the first go round, it took me seven months to realize that I was building way too much and I really should just be out there talking to people. This time, I only spent three weeks before I caught myself building too much.

Balance between writing code and writing content is key. Creating new content consistently will help drive new traffic to your site, create inbound messaging from new people and keep the motivation up.

Writing code will produce something that will hopefully deliver value to those people. It's not a race to produce anything. Lasting over the long haul is the actual goal.
