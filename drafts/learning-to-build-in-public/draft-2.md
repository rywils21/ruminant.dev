## Failing to Start a Software Business

I've been trying to start a software business for a while. I wrote about how I quit my job and failed to start a business a few weeks ago.

I spent seven months not talking to actual potential customers. "If I built this one feature, people will be signing up in droves," I would tell myself. I would build that feature. Nothing would happen.

"Oh, now I need this other feature. That's what's missing."

I trapped myself thinking features were missing. What was missing was customers.

## The Love of Building

I was always tinkering with things growing up on my parents farm.  During heavy rain I would play in the ditches along our dirt road, making dams with the rocks and mud. I helped repair farm equipment when it broke down. I took a welding class in high school and built my own squat rack.

I'm a builder. The ability to create software is one of the most magical things. Free from the constraints of the physical world, you can build things fast and send them to people from around the world.

This can be both a blessing and a curse. It's a powerful ability. It's also easy to fall into the trap of building with your head in the sand.

After seven long months, I realized I had my head in the sand. I needed to take a complete break from that project. Regardless of the value of any kind of idea there, I wasn't executing.

I had to start something new.

## A new idea

I always have random ideas pop into my head for products or businesses that I might find useful. Luckily, I've been pretty good about not persuing every single one. In the weeks leading up to realizing that I needed to take a break from Polished, I discovered some chrome extensions that did something similar to an app I paid for called Shift (https://tryshift.com).

Now I was coming to the point in being jobless that I was starting to evaluate all of the subscriptions I had. Shift was $99/year, and all I was using it for was switching between email accounts.

The thing about Shift was that I loved it's UI. When it comes to working, and organizing things, a sidebar UI works better than traditional browser tabs. 

But I still loved my browser. Shift was trying to become the default browser you used. As a developer, I frequently need to access the dev tools and am used to a full-featured browser. I didn't want to switch my default browser to Shift.

So I decided to begin working on this idea called Tidy Workspace.

## (Search)

Now I didn't want the same thing that had happened with Polished to happen again with Tidy Workspace. I didn't want to build this solution and stuck telling myself I needed to make that next feature, and people would love it. I had to flip that strategy on its head.

I began by talking to people.

I spent an hour and built a rough design mockup of the idea I had. It was just going to be a simple replacement for Shift that lets you monitor your email accounts from a sidebar in your regular browser.

Then I spent a day building a landing page using the design mockups.

Building the design mockups first did wonders for my ability to create that initial landing page. I was able to include what looked like screenshots of the product right on the initial landing page. I didn't have to resort to using generic illustrations.

I set out to get feedback. 

The initial version was horrible. I was giddy with excitement to get this new idea out there.

By posting on Indiehackers, I happened to get a video review of my landing page from someone. It was the most helpful review I think I've ever gotten on any work. The suggestions were helpful, but they weren't what blew me away. 

This video review made me realize that I had many ideas in my head that random visitors did not. I would look at this landing page and not know what information was missing because I already had all of it in my head. When a stranger looks at it, they instantly see all of the gaps because they have many questions.

Seeing someone look at my landing page and be confused was the shock I needed. When I looked at the landing page, I would think, "Yeah, makes sense." But when someone with no knowledge of what the product is looks at it, they are straight-up confused.

This realization had me so excited. I wanted to share that with other people. So I started offering free landing page reviews for people where I would make a screencast of myself going through their landing page. 

Some people found it incredibly helpful. Some people didn't reply. I made over 70 videos altogether after posting the offer on Indiehackers and ProductHunt. I ended up making a few connections through there of people who had offered to reciprocate.

I made updates to my landing page and product idea based on feedback. Then I reached out to one of the people who had offered to give feedback in return. Used their feedback to make improvements. Then I'd repeat this process. Ask another person, make some updates. So on. Eventually, there wasn't much feedback coming in. They understood the idea. Some people were excited about it.

I set up an email drop in the first version of the landing page. In the matter of a week, I had five people signed up for early access to an idea. I hadn't even written any code yet.

## (Find)

So with people who seemed to understand the product and indicate they were at least interested in trying it out, I decided to start building.

I wasn't going to build the entire thing. I am sticking to the principle of iterating quickly and getting feedback from people. I decided to start but only make the workspace feature and leave the rest for later.

I went utterly heads down for a week and built this feature.

I learned different concepts that go into building a chrome extension. I created the sidebar, isolated the extension CSS from the web pages, and set up event listeners to listen to every tab and window change. 

I learned a lot this week and submitted an initial buggy version to the chrome web store.

## (Take)

I wasn't active online during that whole week. Coding took all of my focus, and I wasn't sharing what I was doing. Coding heads down is a dangerous game to play as a developer. It's easy to fall into that trap and think it needs more features before you should show it to people.

In this week of not posting, traffic from the previous blog post started to die down. Traffic from the weekend of doing landing page reviews began to die down. I was getting fewer messages from new people. It felt like my existence was disappearing.

By the time I was done building this thing, would people even still be interested in it?

When you get the shot of adrenaline that is website traffic and inbound messages, it doesn't feel right when that starts to wear off.

I had told myself I was going to keep blogging this time. I was going to tweet more. There was no reason why I couldn't. I let myself become so consumed with building that I simply didn't make time for those other things because I had convinced myself I needed to build the MVP in a week.

## (Return)

So now, I'm coming back to this world of balancing development and engaging with people. I'm writing this blog post. I'm working on tweeting more.

## (Changed)

I'm learning lessons faster. On the first go-round, it took me seven months to realize that I was building way too much, and I really should just be out there talking to people. This time, I only spent three weeks before I caught myself coding too much.

Balancing between writing code and writing content is critical. Consistently creating new content will help drive new traffic to your site, create inbound messaging from new people, and keep the motivation up.

Writing code will produce something that will hopefully deliver value to those people. It's not a race to create anything. Lasting over the long haul is the actual goal.
