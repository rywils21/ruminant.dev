# Learning to Build in Public - Outline



1. You
   1. Three weeks ago, I wrote about how I quit my job and failed to start a business.
   2. I spent seven months making poor decisions to continue building a thing without actually talking to any prospective customers. You always hear that mantra in the startup world. "Talk to your customers!" But I found it too easy to fall into the trap of telling myself "I just need to build this thing and then I'll start talking to people." That thing would come and it wouldn't feel right, so I'd push it off even further.
   3. So I decided to take a break altogether from that project. A few weeks, if not more. I had a bunch of other ideas I had come up with while working on that and I had just putthem aside because I convinced myself I needed to focus. Focus is good. But not when it's on the wrong thing. You've got to find the right thing to focus on then utilize focus.
2. Need
   1. (Here's the actual need) I wasn't going to give up altogether. I still love to create things. I had lots of other ideas. I have to keep trying and start something new now taking all of the lessons I learned along the way.
3. Go
   1. So I decided to take on the idea for Tidy Workspace.
4. Search
   1. I was a paying user of Shift which is a similar app but built with Electron. They have a lot of users that love their product. The biggest complaint in reviews is their pricing model. $99/year is pretty steep for a glorified browser that lets you quickly switch between email accounts.
   2. I had recently discovered a chrome extension called Switch that inserts that same sidebar UI into your webpages. It's focus was on letting you pin your most frequently visited tabs so you could easily switch to them without keeping those tabs in your tab bar.
   3. This time, I wasn't going to make the same mistakes I did with Polished. I wasn't going to write a line of code until I knew the idea had some legs. I already had a feeling because there were so many other apps like it in the world. It was something I wanted myself. I could stop paying for Shift and this thing I built would at least solve a problem for me.
   4. So I started with design mockups and a landing page.
   5. After building that, I posted on Indiehackers asking for landing page feedback. Randomly, @orliesaurus happened to do a Youtube video of landing page feedback. His feedback was so so helpful in helping me realize that I had a lot of things in my head that were not clear at all on the landing page. _When we have an idea and build a landing page, it's easy for us to look at it and think all of the information is there because we have all of that in our head already._ That's not the case. This was the start to me really iterating on the idea.
   6. I used that feedback to make a new version of my landing page. Now I needed to get feedback again to see if the changes I made were good. But I didn't want to just keep spamming Indiehackers every other day "Landing page updated! Please check it out!" So I decided to give back first. I made a post offering to do screencasts of myself reviewing other peoples' landing pages on Indiehackers and ProductHunt. The response was insane. I ended up making over 70 landing page review videos.
   7. Through this process, a handful of people offered to do it in return. So I'd cash in one review favor, make updates based on that feedback. I'd repeat this about 4 times until the message was clear.
   8. During this, people were signing up for early access. There are a few people who are ecstatic about the idea. I talked to them more in-depth about what problem they were trying to solve.
   9. At first, Tidy Workspace was going to be a sidebar that let you flip between email accounts and your favorite websites. It quickly evolved into the concept of workspaces. The email accounts and favorite tabs were nice-to-have features that I'd build in later on.
   10. I had seven interested people who were on the early access list or in contact via email. This was more interest on anything than I'd ever had before. I decided it was time to start building the MVP.
5. Find
   1. In one week, I went totally heads down and built the MVP. 
6. Take
   1. Now the concept of workspaces is working pretty well and it's time to get it into the hands of customers. It's submitted to the Chrome Web Store. I've started doing insider builds and letting a few people download the unpacked version so they can install it with developer mode before the Chrome Web Store approval happens.
   2. I'm taking the same approach I did on the website. Getting feedback from one person, iterating on it, then reaching out to the next. I'll do this until the product feels really good and I have people saying they can't live without it.
   3. (Take) Throughout these three weeks, though, I have been terrible at posting regular updates and building in public. In the week that I built the MVP, my online presence went dark. Website traffic spurred by that initial post started to dip, inbound messages reduced to zero. It started to feel like a dark place again.
   4. As a developer, it's so easy to get wrapped up in the code, especially when you're learning something new. It's a natural tendency to want to get to the point where we can say, "Hey look! I built this awesome thing." But not so tempting to share the struggles along the entire way.
   5. Spending time on social media feels like a waste of time when there are lines of code that need to be written.
7. Return
   1. Now I'm going to make a better effort to be more public and share more of the journey.
8. Changed
   1. I'm tightening my feedback loop on learning these lessons. Instead of 7 months, this time only took 3 weeks. During the week of building that MVP, I should have been sharing all of the hurdles I hit in building a chrome extension for the first time. I should be sharing my original ideas, the feedback I'm getting, and how I'm adjusting the idea based on that feedback.
   2. It's hard to balance all of the time needed to write code and write blog posts and read and interact in communities. I think it's okay to go slower on the development side for the sake of consistently connecting with new people. New ideas and consistent interaction are a motivating force that will help me keep going. This is about being consistent for a long period of time. Not banging something out in a week and having it be a complete success. The likelihood of that is so low.
