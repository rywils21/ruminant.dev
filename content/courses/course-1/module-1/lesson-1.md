# Lesson 1

This is an initial go at creating some fake markdown in order to test the lesson and module setup.

Links look like [this](https://polished.app)

Seems like there will definitely need to be some formatting done on this content.

## h2

```
function test() {
  const x = 4;
}
```

and an inline code `const x = 4;` looks as such.
