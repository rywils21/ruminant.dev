# The Software Engineering Crash Course

A fast-paced course covering a range of topics required for building real websites and applications.

## Anyone can build real websites and applications

Ever wonder "What next?" while learning to code? Theres a TON of free information out there. It's hard to know where to start. If you've learned a skill, it's hard to know how to apply it.

## Don't just learn. Build.

### Completely FREE

All of the software and tools used in this course are completely free or take advantage of some free tier. The course content will always be free.

### Build and deploy a website

You'll have a real working website with a URL you can share.

### Build first, read later

Technical explanations can be hard to internalize. Gain the experience of building something first to see how it works.

### Don't write throwaway code

All courses and modules build real world projects. Use them to build out a portfolio. Extend them, repurpose them, make them yours.

## The course I wish I had

### Traditional curriculums are bloated

I had to get a degree in Software Engineering, have internships, and work full-time to learn what I know about software development. It took about three years before I understood web development. It took about three more before I could build my own complete projects.

### Make your time count

Learn the most important concepts first. Fill in the gaps as you go. Working on real projects is the most valuable experience you can get.
