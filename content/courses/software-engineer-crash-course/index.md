# Software Engineer Crash Course

Welcome!

This course introduces you to the topics you need to know if you have or want a job building software.

Many "learn to code" courses start out by saying, "Decide if you want to be a frontend or backend developer." If you are just starting out, how are you supposed to know how to answer that question?

This introductory course covers a broad range of topics including both backend and frontend, along with systems and computer science concepts.

It is purposefully light on lectures. We believe the best way to learn is to dive right in and build real things.
